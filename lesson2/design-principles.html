        <p> The principle of visual hierachy is applied in this image and website as the first to cathe the attention <br>
        of a reader is the broad heading of "consulting" which is followed by the image of the woman and after which the <br>
        sub heading and the paragrapgh text, the way they text is arrange makes viewing very great an simple and also directs <br>
        the reader or viewer to what's important on that page of the website.</p>

        <h2> White Space and Clean Design</h2>

        <img id="screen" src="images/Screenshot_20230114_031000_white.jpg" alt="screenshot">
        <p>From the presentation of information on this page, there wasa lot of white of blank space left within <br>
        the design to accomodate for more easier viewing and great professional presentation as well. It make the work <br>
        more easier to read and prevents over-crowding of words.</p>

        <h3> Visual Studio Code</h3>
        <a id="link" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">visualstudiocode.com</a>
        <img id="screen" src="images/Screenshot_20230114_033625_alignment.jpg" alt="screenshot">
        <p> This website utilises the principle of alignment perfect in my view, because as it can be seen from <br>
        from the image, the text used all have a similar grid with which they follow, they are all in line per their section <br>
        on text or group of text falls out of line with in the image and they present a uniform front with great visual effect <br>
        and great professionalism</p>
