        We live in the social media era where people love sharing what they are experiencing and keeping
        the memories online. Just imgine how great it would be to feel the breeze and beautiful of the green land.
        Saying greenland, i am refering to the vegatation. As part of our welome act to all people in the world, Accra boasts
        of a canopy walk through the thick "Kakum National Forest". For on this experience is great and eye opening.
        It gives the scare mostly seeing the height of the walk and the unknown animals in the forest, but all who try
        have never had a dull or unexcitin moment. The question no is what are you waitin for.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Just give it a try.
