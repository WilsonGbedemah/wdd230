          Ghana as a country is great and full of amazing things, most especily, the capital of the country
          the other towns and citys have amazing experinces and the focus is on the capital for now. This holds
          the famous Flagstaff house and many indigenious and great sceneriess as well. Havng a life in Accra for 
          most is a great thing although it is not devoid of it's difficulties. Without further a do,
          lets dive inüòä.

          We live in the social media era where people love sharing what they are experiencing and keeping
          the memories online. Just imgine how great it would be to feel the breeze and beautiful of the green land.
          Saying greenland, i am refering to the vegatation. As part of our welome act to all people in the world, Accra boasts
          of a canopy walk through the thick "Kakum National Forest". For on this experience is great and eye opening.
          It gives the scare mostly seeing the height of the walk and the unknown animals in the forest, but all who try
          have never had a dull or unexcitin moment. The question no is what are you waitin for.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Just ive it a try.

          Ghana as a country has many resources at her disposal to work on for all other nations to benefits as well, and as 
          a way of prodings and helping all other nations, Ghana is known for her magnificient production of "Cocoa". the production and processing 
          of cocoa is what is use to prdue the finished goods of " Chocolate" hich to many is a sin of love, and appreciation.
          the indigenious cocoa produced in the region not only provides inome to the nationbut also provdes lots of job employment
          as well to the mamy citizen of the town.

          Accra precily hase lots of business running, being it small scle, medium and even large scale businesses, which go along way to make 
          the town poplated as many people travel long distances just to start businesses, fr some it goes well but for ohers too, it does not, but there are not detered. 
          The most common sight you see on the streets of Accra is the "hawkers". They carry lots of caned and bottled finished products like bottled water,
          beverage for sales as a means to make a living, I solemly respect these people as i go about the streets and see them as people who seek to make 
          a difference. I hope you see that as well.

          As one who is fun of food, which i know you also areüòÖ, I think you would find this sigt very appeling and great. The most common sight on in 
          Accra is the sight of roasted plaintain, This gives me te chills. Walking through th streets of Accra and wanting to have a fill of a snack,
          nothing tstes better than this. Its tastes better than the way it looks mostly. This sereves as food to a whole lot of people in the city,
          it nourishes and satisfies as well.

          Accra is actually by a lot of water bodies and also has some lagons and lakes in it. As a result, most natives of the city sometimes turn to fishing as
          as a means of ocupations while some hve the chance to feel the breeze of the se in ways like visiting beaches for receations and fun activities. Fishing
          provides the natin with fishes for our foods and many other sea creatures and also provieds a source of employmet and income while the beachesserve as fun moments
          for families and everyone to enjoy.

          The world at large has a great concern with te opulation growth, as they seek to reduce or even halt it,s growth.
          This for once has been an issue for my country and precisely Accra being the capital attrcat lots of poeple fro all
          parts of te country for greener pastures, and thsi has created a great population over flow in Acrra which to some extend cause
          lots of problems ranging from suffering to floods and diseases as well.
