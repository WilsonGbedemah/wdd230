    <h2>GHANA</h2>
    <p>
      Ghana became a Republic once more on 1 October 1969 when the National Liberation Council
      handed power over to civilian rule. A new constitution was drafted based on the parliamentary 
      system of government in the United Kingdom. Between 1972 and 1979, Ghana fell under the rule 
      of several military dictators. Ghana has a lot of rich cultre and traditions which her people 
      or citizen do not take for granted.

        We live in the social media era where people love sharing what they are experiencing and keeping
        the memories online. Just imgine how great it would be to feel the breeze and beautiful of the green land.
        Saying greenland, i am refering to the vegatation. As part of our welome act to all people in the world, Accra boasts
        of a canopy walk through the thick "Kakum National Forest". For on this experience is great and eye opening.
        It gives the scare mostly seeing the height of the walk and the unknown animals in the forest, but all who try
        have never had a dull or unexcitin moment. The question no is what are you waitin for.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Just give it a try.

        Ghana as a country has many resources at her disposal to work on for all other nations to benefits as well, and as 
        a way of producings and helping all other nations, Ghana is known for her magnificient production of "Cocoa". the production and processing 
        of cocoa is what is use to prduce the finished goods of "Chocolate" and the rest which to many is a sign of love, and appreciation.

        as well to the many citizens of the Accra, in terms of processing amd packaging for the cocoa crop for exportation.

        Accra precisely has lots of business running, being it small scale, medium and even large scale businesses, which goes a long way to make 
        the town poplated, as many people travel long distances just to start businesses, for some it goes well but for ohers it does not, but there are not detered. 
        The most common sight you see on the streets of Accra is the "hawkers". They carry lots of canned and bottled finished products like bottled water,
        beverage for sales as a means to make a living, I solemly respect these people as i go about the streets and see them as people who seek to make 
        a difference. I hope you see that as well.

        As one who is fond of food, which i know you also areüòÖ, I think you would find this sigt very appealing and great. One of the most common and popular sight on in 
        Accra is the sight of roasted plaintain, This gives me the chills. Walking through the streets of Accra and wanting to have a fill of a snack,
        nothing tastes better than this. Its tastes better than the way it looks mostly. This sereves as food to a whole lot of people in the city,
        it nourishes and satisfies as well.

        Accra is actually by a lot of water bodies and also has some lagons and lakes in it. As a result, most natives of the city sometimes turn to fishing as
        as a means of ocupations while some have the chance to feel the breeze of the sea in ways like visiting beaches for recreations and fun activities. Fishing
        provides the nation with fish for our foods and many other sea creatures and also serves as a source of employment and income while the beaches serve as fun moments
        for families and everyone to enjoy.

    The world at large has a great concern with the population growth, as they seek to reduce or even halt it's growth.
    This for once has been an issue for my country and precisely Accra being the capital attracts lots of poeple from all
    parts of the country who seek greener pastures, and this has created over population in Acrra which to some extend cause
    lots of problems ranging from suffering to floods and diseases as well.
